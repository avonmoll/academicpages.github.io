A three agent pursuit-evasion differential game in the Euclidean plane where two pursuers engage an Evader is considered. The Pursuers are faster than the Evader and the three player have simple motion/are holonomic. Coincidence of the Evader with either one, or both Pursuers, is capture, and time of capture is the payoff/cost. In this paper Isaacs’ Two Cutters and Fugitive Ship differential game is revisited and the solution of the Game of Kind is provided. Using Isaacs’ geometric method, explicit formulae for the players’ optimal state feedback strategies and the Value of the game are derived. The merits of the suboptimal Evader tactic of reducing speed, or opting to stay stationary, are examined.
