The insertion of advanced technologies into gas turbine engines is expected to reduce costs and improve performance. Engines will be getting smaller and hotter for efficiency reasons, requiring diverse types of sensors, in particular pressure and temperature sensors, with extended and enhanced performance. Emerging fiber-optic sensing approaches could provide a unique solution to surpassing the limitations and burden of conventional sensors. Two novel multiplexable fiber optic-based pressure sensor designs are discussed for high-temperature operations up to 1,800 °F and 3,700 °F. These innovative sensor designs enable more direct measurements over long durations, resulting in higher accuracy and stability. These sensors could be used in ground test cells, in-flight control, and diagnostics and prognostic health management (PHM). Highly reliable all-optical sensor networking and interface designs with a high-speed, high-bandwidth fiber-optic backbone is also presented.
