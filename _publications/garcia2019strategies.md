A scenario is considered where a coastline or border is coming under attack by two aircraft. The border is guarded by a faster defender bent on intercepting both aircraft in sequence. A differential game is formulated where the defender sequentially pursues both aircraft and tries to capture them as far as possible from the border. The two aircraft execute cooperative maneuvers and try to minimize their combined distance to the border at the moment when each one is intercepted by the defender. In this paper, the regular solution of this differential game is obtained and the game singular surfaces are identified.
