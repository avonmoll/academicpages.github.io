I am a researcher with the Control Science Center of Excellence, Aerospace Systems Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory.
I hold a B.S. from Ohio State (2012) and an M.S. from Georgia Institute of Technology (2016) both in Aerospace Engineering. 
In 2011 I received the Department of Defense SMART Scholarship.
Then in 2014 I received SMART again to pursue my M.S.


My research interests include multi-agent systems, cooperative control, differential games, and pursuit-evasion.
