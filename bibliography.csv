These improvements will require a more efficient, more reliable, and more advanced propulsion system. The concept of smart components is built around actively controlling the engine and the aircraft to operate optimally. Usage of smart components intelligently increases efficiency and system safety throughout the flight envelope, all while meeting environmental challenges. This approach requires an integration and optimization, both at the local level and the system level, to reduce cost. Interactions between the various subsystems must be understood through the use of modeling and simulation. This is accomplished by starting with individual subsystem models and combining them into a complete system model. Hierarchical, decentralized control reduces cost and risk by enabling integration and modularity. This process involves defining, developing, and validating against requirements for key integrated propulsion, power, and thermal management system capabilities.","2014-09","2016-12-01 16:56:30","2018-07-13 13:12:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","SAE Intenational","","","All rights reserved","","","","Google Scholar","","","","/Users/vonmolal/Zotero/storage/XJH65H5H/Behbahani et al. - 2014 - Aircraft Integration Challenges and Opportunities .pdf; /Users/vonmolal/Zotero/storage/7V6G7TTA/Behbahani et al_2014_Aircraft Integration Challenges and Opportunities for Distributed Intelligent.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SAE 2014 Aerospace Systems and Technology Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fuel actuator pumping systems contribute to the challenge by constantly injecting waste heat into the fuel system. This is due to a fundamental mismatching between an actuation system with a low duty cycle and a pump which is always running. Since the pump is directly coupled to the gearbox, the detriment is twofold: horsepower is always being drawn to drive the pump, and heat is generated. Furthermore, the emergence of variable cycle engines pushes the actuation system in the direction of more effectors and more loads, which drives requirements for high pressure and high flows from the pumping system. Piston pumps have been seen as favorable for the actuation pump application due to their high single stage pressure rise capability. However reducing the number of pumping components alone has not solved the thermal management issue. Variable displacement pumps have been designed to operate over a range of conditions in order to deliver flow more appropriately as demanded by the control system. These pumps allow pressure and flow to be modulated independent of one another and of the pump’s rotational speed. Variable displacement pumps may be considered as a component of a partial-demand actuation pumping system. Even in a partial-demand actuation pumping system, a variable displacement pump will still be coupled to the gearbox and require some minimum flow for lubrication and cooling. On-demand actuation fuel systems deliver only the amount of flow that is being demanded at a given time so that waste heat is minimized. In other words, the duty cycle of the pumping system matches that of the actuation system. The development of an on-demand actuation fuel system will require a new architecture and new components.","2014","2016-12-01 16:56:30","2018-07-13 12:51:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","JANNAF Interagency Propulsion Committee","","","All rights reserved","","","","Google Scholar","","","","/Users/vonmolal/Zotero/storage/WZ49VPFM/Von Moll et al_2014_Recent Progress, Challenges, and Future Development Needs of Thermally-Energy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Perhaps the most touted benefit of a DECS is the potential to reduce the amount of harnessing which connects throughout the engine. Such a system is comprised of several network sections incorporating control nodes or data concentrators (DCs). These DCs contain control logic to perform control function computations and are connected to the full authority digital engine control (FADEC) via a high-speed data communication bus. A novel approach for analyzing and evaluating three topologies–ring, star, and bus–in the context of a relevant military engine was described. In this study, the algorithm uses a particle swarm optimization process to evolve solutions to a multi-objective optimization problem. The results of this study indicate there is potential for large wire length savings in a distributed control architecture.","2013","2016-12-01 16:56:30","2018-07-13 13:14:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISA","","","All rights reserved","","","","Google Scholar","","","","; /Users/vonmolal/Zotero/storage/CF9J6HEN/Von Moll_Behbahani_2013_Comparison of Communication Architectures and Network Topologies for.pdf","http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA586909","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The data collection task is undertaken by a UAV which autonomously executes the mission. Each node has a priority/ weight associated with it that characterizes the relative importance between timely collection of data from the nodes. In this context, a prudent performance metric is the maximal weighted time between consecutive visits to each node. We wish to minimize the maximum of this metric among all nodes for a given cycle length. Here, the cycle length refers to the total number of nodes (including repeats) visited per cycle. When the cycle length is greater than the number of nodes, some nodes, arguably ones with a higher priority, will be visited more often. We pose the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), that computes the optimal visit sequence and number of visits to each node for a given cycle length. Not surprisingly, the exact method is not scalable with the number of nodes and the cycle length. We therefore present sub-optimal methods  by directly enforcing a pre-specified number of visits to each node. We present an iterative scheme that computes solutions for increasing cycle length with a recipe for updating the number of visits based on the solution from the previous iteration. We compare the optimal and sub-optimal iterative schemes and show that the sub-optimal scheme is an order of magnitude faster than the optimal scheme with minimal loss in performance.","2018-08","2018-03-06 18:16:37","2018-07-13 20:15:54","","","","","Manuscript accepted for publication","","","","","","","","IEEE","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","Manuscript accepted for publication","","/Users/vonmolal/Zotero/storage/A4CAP5N9/Kalyanam et al_2018_Scalable and Exact MILP Methods for UAV Persistent Visitation Problem.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Conference on Control Technology and Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This report explores one particular area of interest: trajectory optimization. The Linear Quadratic Regulator and Linear Quadratic Gaussian algorithms are introduced as predecessors to the Iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian (iLQG) algorithm, which is re-derived in this report and demonstrated on 3 systems of interest: cartpole, double cartpole, and quadrotor. iLQG is robust and widely applicable to a vast number of different systems. Probabilistic Differential Dynamic Programming (PDDP) is introduced as an important extension to iLQG which incorporates uncertainty into the trajectory optimization process. The conceptual advances presented in this report were centered around the use of a Gaussian Process Regression Network (GPRN) to represent the unknown system dynamics in lieu of the standard Gaussian Process representation employed by PDDP. GPRNs offer a more sophisticated noise model and a more adaptive regression framework. More speciffcally, they incorporate input-dependent noise and signal correlation between multiple outputs. This should enhance the predictive capability of the algorithm to represent the unknown system dynamics. Work remains on fully incorporating GPRN into a PDDP-like algorithm: effort continues in the areas of understanding variational Bayes and variational message passing for learning GPRN hyperparameters, and in creating a MATLAB implementation.","2015","2018-04-02 15:49:49","2018-07-13 13:03:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","Georgia Institute of Technology","","","All rights reserved","MS Special Project","","","","","Special Project AE8900","","/Users/vonmolal/Zotero/storage/3I8YUWFT/Von Moll_2015_Machine Learning Applications in Complex Control Systems.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main objective of this investigation is to exploit the benefits of cooperation amongst the pursuers in order to reduce the capture time of the evader. Computational complexity is a chief concern as this problem would need to be solved in an online fashion, e.g. in the case of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles. A new geometric approach to solving the game is introduced and analyzed, which changes the problem of optimizing over continuous domains to a discrete combinatoric optimization. While past efforts at solving multiple pursuer problems have suffered from the curse of dimensionality, the geometric algorithms put forth here are shown to be scalable. Categorization and removal of redundant pursuers is the primary means by which scalability is achieved. The solution of this problem serves as a stepping stone to more complex problems such as the M-pursuer N-evader differential game.","2018-06","2018-05-01 19:26:21","2018-05-09 14:55:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dallas, TX","","All rights reserved","","IEEE Xplore","","","","","","/Users/vonmolal/Zotero/storage/NFH42JLL/Von Moll et al_2018_Pursuit-evasion of an Evader by Multiple Pursuers.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (ICUAS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ongoing development of a novel reliability analysis methodology to quantify sensor network reliability in harsh environments is discussed. Failure modes, mechanisms, and effects analysis (FMMEA) was performed for jet engine environments.

EGT measurement is considered a key parameter for optimizing fuel economy, diagnosis, and prognosis. The reason is that turbine blade temperature is a good indicator for normal life consumption of that blade. Currently, direct sensor measurements made on turbine modules are limited due to the extremely hot environment. Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) sensors located downstream from the highest temperature sections provide a means to roughly infer the temperatures seen by the turbine blades/disks. But these sensors, which themselves are subject to frequent failures, provide a fairly inaccurate indication of the actual metal temperature profiles. This is of particular importance for high performance military turbine engines where the margin between hot-section operating conditions and material limitations is shrinking. A future state is envisioned that would use emerging pyrometric, fiber optic, and laser-based sensing to accurately assess the condition and life usage of the hot section, on a blade-by-blade basis.","2014-07-25","2018-07-13 12:55:56","2018-07-13 12:57:38","2018-07-13 12:55:56","","","","","","","","AIAA Propulsion and Energy Forum","","","","American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics","","","All rights reserved","","","","arc-aiaa-org.wrs.idm.oclc.org (Atypon)","","DOI: 10.2514/6.2014-3977","","/Users/vonmolal/Zotero/storage/ME458QRA/6.html; /Users/vonmolal/Zotero/storage/LF486FK6/Von Moll et al_2014_A Review of Exhaust Gas Temperature Sensing Techniques for Modern Turbine.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective is to minimize the maximum weighted revisit time over all the sites in a cyclicly repeating walk. In general, the optimal length of the walk is not known, so this method (like the exact methods) assume some fixed length. Exact methods for solving the problem have recently been put forth, however, in the absence of additional heuristics, the exact method scales poorly for problems with more than 10 sites or so. By using a genetic algorithm, performance and computation time can be traded off depending on the application. The main contributions are a novel chromosome encoding scheme and genetic operators for cyclic walks which may visit sites more than once. Examples show that the performance is comparable to exact methods with better scalability.","2018-10","2018-07-13 13:31:15","2018-07-13 20:13:54","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASME","Atlanta, GA","","All rights reserved","","","","","","Accepted for presentation","","/Users/vonmolal/Zotero/storage/E8W9N4X5/Von Moll et al_2018_Genetic Algorithm Approach for UAV Persistent Visitation Problem.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Dynamic Systems and Control Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we consider a scenario in which a team of UAVs (the pursuers)  attempt to prevent an intruder ground vehicle (the evader) from escaping through the border. The ground intruder’s presence is made known by a laser fence positioned inside the border. Upon detection, the UAVs are activated and given the objective to cooperatively capture the intruder. We formulate the scenario as a zero-sum differential game whereupon all agents exhibit simple motion and the pursuers have a speed advantage. For cases where capture inside the border is possible, the payoff/cost for the pursuers/evader is the distance from capture to the border. The solution to the game is derived based on the geometric properties of the game and verified for the single pursuer case with a border comprised of straight-line segments. This game may contain a dispersal surface which has interesting practical consequences when the optimal strategies are applied in discrete time.","2019","2018-07-13 13:35:51","2018-07-13 13:40:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","AIAA","San Diego, CA","","All rights reserved","","","","","","Submitted for review","","/Users/vonmolal/Zotero/storage/MVCWPUW9/Von Moll et al_2019_Multiple Pursuer Single Evader Border Defense Differential Game.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AIAA SciTech","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
